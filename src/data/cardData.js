      description: "<i>At bottom, the specter is the future, it is always to come, it presents itself only as that which could come or come back.</i> \n in this world nothing is coming back is a VR walking simulator into a deeply personal virtual world of introspection and memory, featuring machine learning generated videos. \n The game oscillates between the haunting presence of the past, the unreliability of memory, and the unsettling uncertainty of the future. While blurring these contingencies into a blender of regrets marked indelibly by personal history, slowly tasting words that are swallowed back, memories eaten by mould, and the bitterness of growing up is unreliably sampled, like the fragmented visions and thoughts that flicker and fade as one drifts to sleep",
