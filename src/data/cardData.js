      description: "<i>At bottom, the specter is the future, it is always to come, it presents itself only as that which could come or come back.</i> \n in this world nothing is coming back is a VR walking simulator into a deeply personal virtual world of introspection and memory, featuring machine learning generated videos. \n The game oscillates between the haunting presence of the past, the unreliability of memory, and the unsettling uncertainty of the future. While blurring these contingencies into a blender of regrets marked indelibly by personal history, slowly tasting words that are swallowed back, memories eaten by mould, and the bitterness of growing up is unreliably sampled, like the fragmented visions and thoughts that flicker and fade as one drifts to sleep",

      description: "1,000 years into the future, human science and technology have achieved countless breakthroughs. A collective consciousness comes to life by residing within the quantum. Entangling itself,  it gives birth to a utopia free of anxiety, separation and any restrictions by physical forms, liberating humanity from the cycles of life. \n  Nonetheless, as the protagonist transits toward the state of everlasting peace, she struggles with the fading of her emotions, no matter whether they were pain or happiness. Memories of the past rush to her mindâ€”from being born in the stream of blood to being diluted in the stream of information. Regrettably, the loss of love breeds frustration. She ponders, is that a gateway to paradise or merely a narcotic to numb her soul?",
