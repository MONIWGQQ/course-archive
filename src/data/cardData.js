      description: "This artwork reflects my relationship with nuclear energy. My interest in this type of power dates back to when I was 11 years old, around the time of the Fukushima disaster in Japan. This catastrophe has always fascinated me, possibly due to its relevance to my personal experiences. \n This experience led me to change in many ways. In my artwork, I depict fish and objects from the perspective of my unique thoughts and dreams. These thoughts and dreams reside within me like a pot, similar to how nuclear power resides within a single atom, and the reactor can be seen as swaddling clothes. Ultimately, it spirals out of control and explodes…",

      description: "<i>At bottom, the specter is the future, it is always to come, it presents itself only as that which could come or come back.</i> \n in this world nothing is coming back is a VR walking simulator into a deeply personal virtual world of introspection and memory, featuring machine learning generated videos. \n The game oscillates between the haunting presence of the past, the unreliability of memory, and the unsettling uncertainty of the future. While blurring these contingencies into a blender of regrets marked indelibly by personal history, slowly tasting words that are swallowed back, memories eaten by mould, and the bitterness of growing up is unreliably sampled, like the fragmented visions and thoughts that flicker and fade as one drifts to sleep",

      description: "1,000 years into the future, human science and technology have achieved countless breakthroughs. A collective consciousness comes to life by residing within the quantum. Entangling itself,  it gives birth to a utopia free of anxiety, separation and any restrictions by physical forms, liberating humanity from the cycles of life. \n  Nonetheless, as the protagonist transits toward the state of everlasting peace, she struggles with the fading of her emotions, no matter whether they were pain or happiness. Memories of the past rush to her mind—from being born in the stream of blood to being diluted in the stream of information. Regrettably, the loss of love breeds frustration. She ponders, is that a gateway to paradise or merely a narcotic to numb her soul?",
