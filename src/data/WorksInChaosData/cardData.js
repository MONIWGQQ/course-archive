         "Subtle but mesmerising, this piece comprised of sweet memories in sound and picture depicts the stream of consciousness where memories can become distorted and become ruminated on in the mind.\n" +
         "The movement reflects the decision between the deterioration or distortion of these memories in order to accept them as complicated emotion alters perspective.\n" +
         "To arrive at acceptance, do you move on with ignorance and erosion or optimistic and rosy retrospection?\n" +

        "\"Altered Perception\" is a video installation that explores the fragility of reality in a dystopian world.\n" +
        "The piece overwhelms, disorients, and provokes—forcing the audience into an altered state where the boundary between the real and the simulated dissolves.\n" +
        "This work reflects the modern condition: a world where we consume endless digital stimuli, often without questioning their origin or intent.\n" +
        "The work challenges viewers to question whether their perceptions are truly their own or an accumulation of external influences, where meaning is constantly redefined, reinterpreted, and rewritten.\n" +
        "I have constructed a world that feels familiar yet fractured, urging the audience to engage physically and emotionally.\n" +
        "At times, the audio feels hypnotic, drawing the audience in; at others, it abruptly fractures—shocking them into awareness.\n" +
        "The intention is not just to show a dystopian reality but to make the audience feel it, embedding the unease of manipulated perception into their subconscious.\n" +
        "Ultimately, \"Altered Perception\" is not just a vision of a dystopian future—it is a reflection of the present.\n" +
        "It is about the way we process the world, the forces that shape our reality, and the terrifying possibility that we may never fully see things as they truly are.",
