      The Bc Digital Arts Computing cohort present their
degree show exhibition 'Fog Rot'. Working at the
hybrid edges between art and technology, its artists
exhibit work spanning sculpture, multimedia
installation, performance, durational art, immersive
soundscapes, and more.
'Fog Rot' explores cultural conditions of forgetting
and the transience of memory in times of constant
change and optimisation. By positioning 'Fog' and
'Rot' as an anagram for 'forgot', we suggest that we
have even forgotten what it is to forget in the first
place. Processes of memory decay can be paralleled
to ecological processes of decomposition, where
dampness grows, with slowness, moving in uncanny
and ghostlike ways. What can slowness offer us in
the face of ongoing change? 'Fog Rot' questions the
role of technology in contributing to accelerated
narratives of catastrophe, asking how digital decay
can offer a different language for understanding the
material relationships between technology, art and
the ways in which forgetting gives us the task of re-
remembering what it is that we are trying to say.
