This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). I used the following options:   
Would you like to use TypeScript? ✘   
Would you like to use ESLint? ✔   
Would you like to use Tailwind CSS? ✔   
Would you like to use `src/` directory? ✔   
Would you like to use App Router? (recommended) ✔   
Would you like to customize the default import alias? ✘   

## Getting Started
first you need you install node.js in your PATH.
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
